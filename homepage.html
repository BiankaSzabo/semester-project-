          Come join us at the Community Science Museum, where we're committed to making science accessible to all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the course of human history, science developed from our early understanding of fire, wind, water, and
          earth
          to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building blocks of life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries and
          perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook but brought to life through exhibits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why we have over 1,000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life (apart from
          the
          dinosaur exhibits — they only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).

            Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come on down to our museum, there's plenty to
            see
            and do. You can learn about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel back in time and meet
            our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure
            you
            come ready to learn and explore. We also have the Young Stars Club, which meets once a week on a Saturday
            between 10:00 and 13:00, where you'll get to explore and experiment with our team of experts. During the
            school holidays, we run special holiday clubs where you can join other children your age to go on a journey
            of
            discovery. Each holiday, we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more about the holiday club and how you
            can join, send us a message.

            and
            provide great video presentations that will excite and inspire them. Please get in touch with us here to

            out more about our facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through for a visit.
