          Get Involved
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Support
        </h3>
        <p>
          There are various ways you can support the museum. Donations are very welcome and are an important
          way we keep this museum open and accessible to the whole community.
          You can also support us by donating items of interest to the museum's collections.
          If you have some item or collection that you think others would enjoy, please let us know by contacting
          our Collections Department and they will be able to assist you.
        </p>

        <h3>Volunteer</h3>
        <p>
          A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the displays in good order and ready for
          visitors to come and enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see behind the scenes of a working
          museum, access to staff-only lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers come together to
          discuss ideas for future exhibits and strategies for the museum.
          You can help volunteer in a number of different spheres. Please contact us
          if you'd like to find out more about how you can get involved.
        </p>

        <h3>Internships</h3>
        <p>
          Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the fun and excitement of sharing the
          wonders of nature with people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an internship at the museum.
          You'll be learning from a number of different academics and people who are passionate about
          science and sharing it with the wider community.

          The bones in your body are like superheroes! When you`re born, you have about 300 bones, but as you grow, some
          of the fuse together, leaving you with 206 bones by the time you`re an adult. Your strongest bone is the
          femure
          (thigh bone), and the tiniest one is inside your ear - it`s smaller than a grain of rice! Your skeleton is
          like
          the framework of a building - it holds you up and gives you shape! Without it, you`d be like a jellyfish! It
          also protects important part of your body, like your heart, brain, and lungs, so you can stay safe while you
          run, jump, and play!
